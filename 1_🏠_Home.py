    This app can be used to create fresh isolated snowflake sandboxes that can be used for testing, development or for technical job interviews. 
    Using the benefits of both Streamlit user-interface and snowflake objects and tool sets any user ( from any background ) can set up a sandbox with one click.

    The usage of this app is pretty stight forward.
    - Login using your snowflake account ( use an account with sufficant privillages to create databases and roles ).
    - Wait for the app to install the supporting objects.
    - Provide the usename and the expiration date of the sandbox.
    - Click setup button.
    - Repeat the two previous steps as much as needed.
    
    üîî PS : For the  login the user must use a user with the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role or a role with sufficiant privillages to create users, roles and databaseobjects.

    After the first login the app will create the supporting object for the app. 
    Thes objects consist of the folowing:
    - A new role sandbox-monitor-role : this role will be used by the sandbox monitor user and will have the sufficent privillages to monitor and control and created sandboxes.
    - A new user sandbox-monitor : this user can be used to monitor the sandboxes created.
    - A new database sandbox-main : this database will contain all the supporting objects for the system.
    - A new table sandbox-log : this table will be used to monitor the created sandboxes and users. 
    - A new procedure sandbox-log : this procedure will be used to create the sandbox.
    - A new procedure sandbox-log : this procedure will be used to delete the sandbox and will be triggered by the task.
    - A new task sandbox-log : this task will run automatically every day at 00:00 and will delete the expired sandboxes.

    When setting up a new sanbox, the app will induct  the following steps : 
    - Create a role with the neccessary privillages to use the newly created sandbox.
    - Create a user with a default password 'Password123' that will be requested to change after the first log-in.
    - Create a new database for the sandbox.
    - Create a new table with one variant column for every file uploaded.
    
    - In case the user selected to upload data to the sandbox, for every uploaded file, a table with one variant column will be created which included the uploaded data.
