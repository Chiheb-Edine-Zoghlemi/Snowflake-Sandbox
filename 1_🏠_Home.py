    This app can be used to create fresh isolated snowflake sandboxes that can be used for testing, development or for technical job interviews. 
    Using the benefits of both Streamlit user-interface and snowflake objects and tool sets any user ( from any background ) can set up a sandbox with one click.

    This usage of the app is very simple. as first step you have to provide your snowflake account. This account must have the sufficent role privillages ( to create databases, roles and user ) something like ACCOUNTADMIN role will be more than sufficiant.
    After the login the app will create the supporting object for the system to run. thes objects consist of the folowing:
    - A new role sandbox-monitor-role : this role will be used by the sandbox monitor user and will have the sufficent privillages to monitor and control and created sandboxes.
    - A new user sandbox-monitor : this user can be used to monitor the sandboxes created.
    - A new database sandbox-main : this database will contain all the supporting objects for the system.
    - A new table sandbox-log : this table will be used to monitor the created sandboxes and users. 

    just config the app to work with your snowflake account by providing your credentials and the app will setup everything by itself.
    Then just provide the sandbox username and the expiration date in which you want the sandbox yo be deleted and the app will setup the sandbox.
    Setting up the sanbox consist of the following steps : 
    - Create a new database for the sandbox.
    - Create a role with the neccessary privillages to use the newly created sandbox.
    - Create a user with a default password 'Password123' that will be requested to change after the first sign in.
    - In case the user selected to upload data to the sandbox, for every uploaded file, a table with one variant column will be created which included the uploaded data.
