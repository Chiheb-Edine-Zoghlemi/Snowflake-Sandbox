# Snowflake-Sandbox

## General Description

This app can be used to create fresh isolated snowflake sandboxes that can be used for testing, development or for technical job interviews. 
Using the benefits of both Streamlit user-interface and snowflake  tools set, any user ( from any background ) can set up a sandbox with one click. 

## Usage Guide

The usage of this app is pretty straight forward.

- Login using your snowflake account ( use an account with sufficient privileges to create databases and roles ).
- Wait for the app to install the supporting objects.
- Provide the username and the expiration date of the sandbox.
- Click setup button.
- Repeat the two previous steps as much as needed.
ðŸ”” PS : For the login, the user must use a user with the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role or a role with sufficient privileges to create users, roles and database objects.

## Technical Description

After the first login the app will create the supporting object for the app. 
Thes objects consist of the folowing:

- A new role sandbox-monitor-role : this role will be used by the sandbox monitor user and will have the sufficent privillages to monitor and control and created sandboxes.
- A new user sandbox-monitor : this user can be used to monitor the sandboxes created.
- A new database sandbox-main : this database will contain all the supporting objects for the system.
- A new table sandbox-log : this table will be used to monitor the created sandboxes and users.
- A new warhouse SANDBOX_MONITOR_WH : this warhouse can be used by the sandbox monitor user.
- A new procedure SANBOX_SETUP : this procedure will be used to create the sandbox.
- A new procedure SANDBOX_DROP : this procedure will be used to delete the sandbox and will be triggered by the task.
- A new task CLEAN_SANDBOX : this task will run automatically every day at 00:00 and will delete the expired sandboxes.

When setting up a new sanbox, the app will conduct the following steps :

- Create a role with the neccessary privillages to use the newly created sandbox.
- Create a user with a default password 'Password123' that will be requested to change after the first log-in.
- Create a new database for the sandbox.
