ðŸ”” PS : For the  login the user must use a user with the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role or a role with sufficiant privillages to create users, roles and databaseobjects.

## Technical Description

After the first login the app will create the supporting object for the app. 
Thes objects consist of the folowing:

- A new role sandbox-monitor-role : this role will be used by the sandbox monitor user and will have the sufficent privillages to monitor and control and created sandboxes.
- A new user sandbox-monitor : this user can be used to monitor the sandboxes created.
- A new database sandbox-main : this database will contain all the supporting objects for the system.
- A new table sandbox-log : this table will be used to monitor the created sandboxes and users.
- A new warhouse SANDBOX_MONITOR_WH : this warhouse can be used by the sandbox monitor user.
- A new procedure SANBOX_SETUP : this procedure will be used to create the sandbox.
- A new procedure SANDBOX_DROP : this procedure will be used to delete the sandbox and will be triggered by the task.
- A new task CLEAN_SANDBOX : this task will run automatically every day at 00:00 and will delete the expired sandboxes.

When setting up a new sanbox, the app will conduct the following steps :

- Create a role with the neccessary privillages to use the newly created sandbox.
